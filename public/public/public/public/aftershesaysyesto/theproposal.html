		<p class="words">Ali,</p>
		<p class="words">
		Words can't say how much you've changed my life. You've made me into a completely different person than I would have been without you, and it's made my life an absolute joy. I've matured and come out of my shell so much, and it's all thanks to you. You make me laugh, you make me think, and you make me so happy. I can't imagine spending my life or having a family with anyone but you. We've been on a few adventures, but I know that this is only the very beginning. You are truly the love of my life, and I want you there with me forever.
